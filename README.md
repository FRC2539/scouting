# FRC Scouting
A repository for querying The Blue Alliance API via python. Intended for general use as a scouting tool for FRC competitions.

You will need a The Blue Alliance API Key, which can be generated here: `https://www.thebluealliance.com/account` under Read API Keys.

You will need to create a python file in your project directory called `API_KEY.py` which should contain the following line of code:  
   `key = '[YOUR_TBA_API_KEY_HERE]'`
   
You should be good to go now!
